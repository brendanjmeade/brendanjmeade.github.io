    The emergence of temporal earthquake clusters in a 1D rate and state model with a weakly harmonic driving velocity.

One of the reasons that earthquake prediction is hard is that the occurrence of large earthquakes is rarely periodic ([Berryman et al., 2012](https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.1218959)).  Paleoseismic records of earthquake activity have been interpreted as consistent with the temporal clustering of large earthquakes in relative compressed time intervals within longer intervals that are sometimes called "supercycles" ([Sieh et al., 2008](https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.1163589)) and two-dimensional numerical models have been developed to explain these observations (e.g., [Barbot, 2020](https://earth-planets-space.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40623-020-01185-3)).

Here we describe a low-dimensional explanation for the emergence of temporally clustered earthquakes that is motivated by recent interpretations of geodetic data as containing low magnitude monthly- ([Bedford et al., 2020](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2212-1)) to centennial-scale ([Meneses-Gutierrez et al., 2022](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2021JB023100#.YfCY_n2JXM0.twitter)) deviations from steady plate motion rates.  These works have analyzed contemporarly and historical data and revealed that small scale 

$$V_p = NNN $$ search is nothing new and countless earthquake precursors candidates have been proposed.  Most of these have been resigned as post-hoc explanations...at best. But the search has continued because lurking behind all of these works is the idea that if the precursory observations were to robustly generalize this would move us forward along the path towards earthquake prediction. Over the past decade possible pre-earthquake correlative observations spanning the solid and fluid earth systems have included:
