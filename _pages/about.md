I work as a professor at Harvard University and with a focus on computational and mathematical approaches to:

- Imaging the space-time activity of the global fault system

- Understanding the earthquake cycle

- Statistical modeling of earthquake sequences and future seismic activity

- Mesoscale links between climate and tectonics

My teaching covers natural disasters, earthquake science, mathematical modeling, applied machine learning, and python programming.
