I work as a professor at Harvard University and my work is focused on computational and mathematical approaches understanding the space-time evolution the earthquake cycle and quantifying future seismic activity.

My teaching covers natural disasters, earthquake science, dynamical systems, artificial intelligence, and python programming.
