#### Prospective graduate students
_What kind of research projects will I be able to get involved in? How soon will I be able to start my research?_
- Ph.D. projects are developed by finding an alignment between interesting problems, scientific interests, and available funding.  Through conversations, directed readings, and code samples you’ll start learning about your first project when you first join the group.  Some projects are data-driven and others are theoretical.  Some projects are based on the application of existing methods, others extend larger software packages, and others are enabled by the development of purpose-built tools.

_What is the typical career path of alumni from your group?_
- Members of our group have gone on to academic positions, employment at technical companies, and further education at professional schools.

_What financial support can I expect?_
- Once enrolled, all graduate students are provided full tuition and a research allowance through the completion of research and teaching assistantships. Prospective students are also encouraged to apply for outside funding from the National Science Foundation and Department of Energy prior to arriving and may contribute to grant writing during graduate school.

_Where can I find information about the application process?_
- For information about the application process and admissions to the graduate program, please see [Harvard EPS graduate admissions page](https://eps.harvard.edu/pages/graduate).  If there are further questions, please contact the graduate program coordinator, [Aimee Smith](mailto:aimee_smith@fas.harvard.edu).
